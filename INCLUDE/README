./INCLUDE:
	Collection of include files used by MIMICA. This includes in particular initial conditions for various
idealized and more realistic test cases, the 'restart.dat' file for MIMICA's restart option, the definition
of all input/output files used by MIMICA (assign), as well as scripts used to interprete the start file and
define the dimensions of the numerical domain ('wheaders.csh' and 'wgrid.csh' respectively).
