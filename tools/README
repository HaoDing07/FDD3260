./tools:
	This folder contains fortran programs used to process MIMICA's raw output data. In particular,
'post_process.f90' can be used to convert the raw data files into formatted files readable by other
visualization softwares (such as Paraview). The program is simply compiled by typing:

	gfortran post_process.f90 -o post_process.exe
	
and is executed with ./post_process.exe. 'post_process' requires a 'file_list.inp' file as an input.
'file_list.inp' is structured as follows: first, under "time", the output times which must be processed
(corresponding to the extensions of the raw data outputs in ./OUTPUT, 0000 corresponding to the 1D profiles),
and under "name" the names of the variables which needs to be processed (Z0 contains the model level heights
and must always be listed first). 'post_process.exe' will then produce a series of formatted files named 
'les_output.tec' gathering all the variables listed in 'file_list.inp', and with an additional extension 
corresponding to the output time (there will be one les_output file per output step selected in 'file_list.inp').
