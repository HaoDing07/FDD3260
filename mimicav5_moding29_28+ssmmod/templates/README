./templates:
	In this folder can be found example input files for a series of idealized and more complex 
test cases. In each template sub-folder, one can find at least 4 files required to run MIMICA
for the corresponding test case:
	- start: the compilation script with the appropriate compilation flags and physical/numerical modules
	- cm.nml: the main MIMICA input file with all the model options and parameters 
	- case_name.h: an include file setting the initial conditions
	- file_list.inp: the input file for the post_process tool needed to convert the raw MIMICA outputs
All these files can serve as templates for your own personal simulations.

	Here is a short description of all the test cases currently included:
	- ASCOS: Semi-idealized case based on ASCOS data.
	- 1D_ADV (OK): Simple one-dimensional advection of a step function for a scalar. Uses the Anelastic approximation by
		default with the QUICK advection scheme, but can be used to test various other scalar advection schemes.
	- 1D_DIFF (OK): One-dimensional diffusion of a step function for a simple scalar. No advection is included.
	- 2D_ADV (OK): Two-dimensional advection of a gaussian blob for a passive scalar. The gaussian is advected along the
		diagonal with fixed u and w velocities (u=w).
	- 2D_NL_ADV: Two-dimensional non-linear (momentum) advection-diffusion of a square shaped velocity field with 
		standard configuration.
	- 2D_DIFF (OK): Two-dimensional diffusion of a gaussian blob along the diagonal with fixed velocities. Anelastic 
		equations with PPM advection and split advection.
	- BUBBLE_ANELASTIC (OK): Warm bubble rising in an homogeneous atmosphere with open boundaries. The case is driven 
		by buoyancy only. The Anelastic assumption is used with TVD advection.
	- BUBBLE_3D (OK): Similar to above but in 3D, with a small amount of diffusion (although not necessary).
	- BUBBLE_COMPRESSIBLE (OK): Same as BUBBLE_ANELASTIC but using the fully compressible conservative solver. 
	- BUBBLE_PRECIP (OK): Saturated rising thermal developing precipitable water at roughly 10m resolution (from Grabowski 
		and Clark 1991). Uses simplified microphysics with saturation adjustment and the compressible solver.
	- BUBBLE_PRECIP_mse (OK): Same as BUBBLE_PRECIP but with moist static energy as conserved variable
	- CONE (OK): Advection of a cone by a rotating flow.
	- DENSITY_CURRENT (OK): An initially cold bubble sinks, hits the surface, and propagates laterally to develop a
		high density current. The case uses the Anelastic approximation, QUICK advection, and a fixed diffusion 
	- DENSITY_CURRENT_MPI (OK): Same as DENSITY_CURRENT but on 4 processors.
        - DENSITY_CURRENT_comp (OK): Same as DENSITY_CURRENT but using the fully compressible solver.
        - DENSITY_CURRENT_conserv (OK): Same as DENSITY_CURRENT but forcing conservation (CONSERVATIVE option, plus pressure 
		solver).
	- DRY_PBL: A two-dimensional dry planetary boundary layer, from the WRF test case suite. Useful to test
		the SGS viscosity and surface fluxes.
	- DYCOMS: 3D DYCOMS cases: a precipitating warm stratocumulus cloud case.
        - HYDRO_ADJUST_1D (OK): Hydrostatic adjustment with a fixed heat source in the middle of the domain. Pseudo 1D domain 
		with open lateral boundaries, vertical periodicity. Non-conservative compressible equations are solved.
	- HYDRO_ADJUST_2D (OK): Hydrostatic adjustment in 2D with fixed heat source in lower part of the domain (Lamb's problem).
		Original config is compressible, periodic with TVD advection. Possibility to switch to anelastic.
	- IGW: Inertia gravity waves. 2D domain with fixed static stability and an initial temperature perturbation at the center.
		QUICK advection scheme with 1km horizontal resolution, and 2nd order RK time-stepping.
	- KMSc: An idealized Sc case using a 2D kinematic framework. Fixed velocity field, homogeneous initial conditions, uses the
		Seifert-Beheng microphysics with detailed activation. Possibility to use with complex cloud-aerosol interactions.
	- MIDLATITUDE: An idealized midlatitude summertime convection case. The grid is 200x200 km2 with 200 m resolution. Parameterizations
		include the full Seifert-Beheng microphysics scheme, Smagorinsky turbulent diffusion. No radiation.
	- ISDAC: based on ISDAC F31: a mixed-phase Arctic stratus cloud case. Possibility to use various options for the
		modelling of the ice phase initiation. Input files are here for a 2D simulation.
	- RCE (OK): A radiative-convective equilibrium case (here in 2D). Anelastic approximation with conserved potential temperature.
		This is just a template for more elaborate RCE simulations.
	- RCEMIP (OK): Setup similar (but not exactly) to the recent RCEMIP intercomparison project. 2D domain only with 1 km horizontal
		resolution and prescribed vertical grid (file grid.dat must be copied in working directory). Interactive radiation 
		with ozone from model scalar 1. 
	- RICO: Setup based on the RICO intercomparison study (trade wind shallow cumulus clouds).
	- SINE (OK): One-dimensional advection of a sine wave. Uses TVD advection by default. Does 20 revolutions.
	- SPIRAL (OK): Advection of a scalar gaussian blob in a rotating flow (prescribed time dependent velocities). Anelastic
		equations with TVD scheme and split advection.
	- SQUALL_LINE (OK): A two-dimensional idealized squall line from the WRF test case suite. Uses the anelastic approximation and
		saturation adjustment with the Seifert-Beheng microphysics (for autoconversion and precipitation).
	- SQUALL_LINE_comp (OK): Mostly similar to the SQUALL_LINE case above, but using the fully compressible core. 
	- TG_VORTEX: Taylor Green vortex (the flow field should be balanced by the pressure field determined by the pressure 
		solver at all time). Fully compressible case with pressure solver, fully periodic. No scalar.
	- TRANSITION: A shallow to deep convection transition case based on TRMM-LBA experiment (Grabowski et al. 2006). The case
		is 2D, with time varying surface fluxes, refined grid in the vertical, and other case specific I/O.
