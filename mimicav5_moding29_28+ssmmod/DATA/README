./DATA:
	A set of specific input data files used by the radiation solver and chemistry module. For radiation,
the background atmosphere in the free troposphere must be prescribed for the solver to work properly. Several
reference atmospheres are provided in .lay files corresponding to various states of the atmosphere. The selected
one should then be renamed 'sounding_rad.dat'.
